Just practicing how to create a directory. In Git, a directory is simply a container for files and other directories. 
It can be thought of as a folder on your computer's file system. A repository, on the other hand, is a collection of files and directories that are tracked by Git and stored in a specific location. 
A repository can contain multiple directories and files, but it is also more than just a collection of files. 
It also includes information about the history of changes made to the files, as well as metadata about the repository itself. 
In summary, a directory is just a container for files, while a repository is a container for files and their history, plus metadata.
