# PowerBI-Dashboards
My PowerBI &amp;  SQL Dashboards
This particular Power BI  report consists of data in CSV format. The idea behind it was to prepare a report for the board of directors where 
they can see the sales trend and forecast by continent, country, region, and category. The report also includes the performance of staff members for every region.
Storage  type: Import mode
Data Model:  Star Schema
 
Brief Description of  Dashboard:
- The general page consists of a Decomposition tree visual which allows us to view the profit for each continent down to the regions; it also has a drill-through 
function that opens up to a new page called 'Details' that provides more information about the region and the managers' sales performance. 
- The scatter plot visual was introduced on the 'Details' page to show us at a glance which of the products consumes more revenue and which generates more profit 
based on the quantities sold.
- The Line chart was  also used on the details page to provide some predictions  (forecasts) for the directors  and this  should aid their decision-making on what
regions and products to commit  resources to
