**Report Highlight**
This particular dashboard is different because it employs the use of "Smart Narratives" almost throughout the report. 
Smart Narratives give quick text summaries about a selected item on a PowerBI report. The SNAs summaries are effective in bringing to light salient points,
and highlighting trends, especially with percentages.These SNAs are fully customizable and can be attached to a lot of visuals to give a further summary and analysis.
